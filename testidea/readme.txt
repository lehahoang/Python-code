This repository contains the Python source code for the finished project. It was developed on top of Pytorch framework.
The main functions of the simulator:
- Training Deep Neural Network (DNN) models
- Doing image classification on the test set
- Injecting bit flips at memory blocks storing DNNs' parameters
- Evaluating the resilience of the network in faulty environment

Dataset used in the project:
- CIFAR-10
- CIFAR-100

DNN models used in the project:
- Lenet-5
- AlexNet
- GoogleNet
- VGG-16 (comming soon)
- MobileNet (comming soon)

Data representation used in the project:
- Single-precision
- (Un)signed Integer (comming soon)

Fault models:
- Random bit-flips
- Stuck-at-faults (coming soon)

Quick tutorial to use this simulator
